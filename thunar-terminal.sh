## Works best when using Thunar > View > Location Selector > Toolbar Style
## Requirements: xdotool, xclip, xfce4-terminal
 
# Todo:
# *) Support for other terminal other than xfce4-terminal?
# *) [Done] Open terminal when viewing remote desktop
#   Was having problem in opening to the correct directory if opened via
#   gsshfs. However fixed in version 0.4.
# *) [Done] Check for dependencies
# *) [Done] Write installation and HelpText
# *) Bug: Doesn't always close the "Open Location" window when Thunar has
#       "Pathbar Style" location. In other words, inconsistence behaviour
#       for "Pathbar Style".
# *) [Done] Bug: Opening terminal to $HOME even when thunar not active
#       -> Typo was removed.
# *) [Done] Activate terminal window after opening
#       -> Ugly hack
 
ScriptName=$(basename $0)
Author="Anjishnu Sarkar"
Version="0.4"
Requirements="xdotool xclip xfce4-terminal"
HelpText="$ScriptName: Script to open a terminal in the same directory as
thunar file manager via shortcut key. Written specifically for openbox.
Can be configured to use in other windows managers as well.
 
The script has support for opening remote folders too.
If thunar is viewing remote desktop and has the location bar in the format
sftp://username@server/remote/home/some/folder
then pressing \"F4\" in that directory, opens a terminal via ssh.
 
Requirements are $Requirements.
Author: $Author, Version: $Version
 
Installation:
Make the script executable
   chmod +x ${ScriptName}
Copy it in your \$PATH
   cp thunar-terminal.sh ~/bin/
 
Openbox configuration:
Open the file ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml and copy these lines under
<!-- Keybindings for running applications -->
   <keybind key=\"F4\">
     <action name=\"execute\">
       <execute>thunar-terminal.sh</execute>
     </action>
   </keybind>
 
Thunar configuration:
Works best if \"Location Selector\" of thunar is in \"Toolbar Style\".
Thunar > View > Location Selector > Toolbar Style.
 
Restart X (Logout and login). Now open thunar, move to any directory and
press \"F4\" to open a terminal in the same directory.
